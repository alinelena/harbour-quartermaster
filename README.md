# Quartermaster
Quartermaster is a native Sailfish OS Homeassistant client which aims to provide the same functionality like the offical Android/iOS app.  
[Homeassistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) is an open source home automation platform written in Python

## Current state of development
The development is in alpha state at the moment. Not everythings works perfectly and needs testing.

## Sailfish OS
This application is tested with Sailfish OS Versions:

- 3.4.0.24 (Pallas Yll√§stunturi)

## Implemented Features
Here is a list of all implemented features so far. Not all features listed below are finished or error free and are still in active development.

**Features:**

- Setup wizard for first start
- Authentification with Long-Lived Access Token (see "Authentication" section)
- Secure storage of all secrets using Sailfish-Secrets
- Device tracking using GPS (not tested well)
- Device tracking using available and connected wifi networks
- Device sensors:  
 - *Battery level* 
 - *Battery charging*
- Entity/Devices control:  

 - *Automation*
 - *Cameras (only single pictures)*
 - *Climate devices (partial)*
 - *Groups*
 - *Lights*
 - *Persons*
 - *Sensors*
 - *Switches*
 - *Zones*
 
- Homeassistant cloud support (not tested)
- Logging of API traffic for development purpose (deactivated by default)
- Update notification if an update of Homeassistant is available.
- Websocket connection for live updates of entity states

## Planned Features
- Two-Factor authentication to get access token (Qt OAuth2 functionality needs at least Qt 5.8 / Sailfish OS 3.4 has antique Qt 5.6 libraries)
- Autodetect Homeassistant instance in local network during setup
- Encryption of API traffic (webhook api)
- Notifications from Homeassistant instance
- Customizable overview page (add special entities to the layout)
- Cover actions
- Automatically switch connection of instance from remote to local url if connected to home network
- Access to history log
- More devices and entity types (need you help because I don't have all of them)
- More device sensors if requested
- all other feature requests

## Homeassistant Configuration
#### Components
To get this app working with Homeassistant you need to activate the following components:

- api
- mobile_app
- webhook

If you have "default_config:" in your configuration.yaml these components should already be active. If you need help please refer to [Homeassistant Documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/).

#### Remote Access

You can get remote access by obtaining a Homeassistant Cloud account (paid subscription needed) or you need to make the instance accessible by internet. 
For self hosting you need a dedicated IP by your provider (not shared one) and a dynamic DNS service because domain name is mandatory since version 0.77.
Please refer to [Homeassistant Documentation](https://www.home-assistant.io/docs/configuration/remote/) for details.

I don't have a cloud account, so no guarantee that this works with this app. In theory it should, all functionality is available for this.

## Authentication
Authentication is only possible with a Long-Lived Access Token at the moment. 
You can create one in profile settings on your Homeassistant web interface.

## Device Tracking
Device tracking is turned of by default. You can activate it in the settings.
Keep in mind that tracking will increase battery usage!
For device tracking a remote access to Homeassistant is mandatory.

#### Wifi Tracking
To work with the wifi tracking you need to define zones inside your homeassistant instance.
Afterwards you can add wifi networks (AP) to the different zones in application settings.  
When your device connects to a tracked network, the app will send the location coordinates of the zone linked to this network as the new device location.

## Development Support
You can help with the development of Quartermaster.

#### Entities / Devices
If you miss some functionality of some devices or you have an unsupported one, you can provide necessary data for development.
In application settings you should turn on API logging to log all api traffic. Don't turn this on all the time, because it will generate a lot of data over time.
   
The files are stored in "Documents/harbour-quartermaster" folder. These files you can pack into an issue report here on GitHub.
